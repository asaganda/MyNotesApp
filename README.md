# My Notes App

This app was created using the fullstack JavaScript Meteor framework as well was the JavaScript library React. I followed a tutorial given from the beginnerprogrammers meetup group host which i attended.

To get the app running locally: 
- simply clone the repo
- terminal command: meteor (should start up the app)
- head on over to localhost:3000 to see it running

A user is able to add and delete notes
